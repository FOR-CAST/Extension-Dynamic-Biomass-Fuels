# What is the Dynamic Biomass Fuels Extension?

The Dynamic Fire System extension must be used in conjunction with this fuel extension. The Dynamic Biomass Fuel extension uses cohort species, age-ranges, and the aboveground live biomass of those cohorts to determine a fuel type for each cell on the landscape. The fuel types should match the fuel types created in the Dynamic Fire System extension. Prescriptions from the Base Harvest extension and mortality from the BDA extension, a wind extension or a fire extension can optionally cause fuel types to change.
